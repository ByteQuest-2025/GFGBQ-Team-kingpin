# Problem Statement
**PS 06 : Predictive Hospital Resource & Emergency Load Intelligence System**
Modern healthcare facilities currently struggle with a reactive approach to crisis management, leading to dangerous emergency overcrowding, critical ICU bed shortages, and chronic staff burnout. This systemic failure is compounded by poor preparedness during seasonal outbreaks or peak demand periods, where hospitals typically only act after an overload has already occurred. To address these challenges, there is a critical need for an AI-powered intelligence system that unifies historical hospital data with local health trends and environmental factors to proactively predict emergency admissions, ICU demand, and staff workload surges. By leveraging these predictive insights, the system aims to optimize staff allocation, bed management, and emergency preparedness planning, ensuring hospitals can effectively handle patient influxes before they compromise care quality.
